# My reactJs e-commerce

I am Pilar Antelo, I am 18 years old, and I studied the React Js course at Coderhouse [https://www.coderhouse.com]. This application is an e-commerce project created as the final project for the React course. In the future, I would like to make improvements to this project, such as simulating user registration, a payment simulation, or aesthetic enhancements.
